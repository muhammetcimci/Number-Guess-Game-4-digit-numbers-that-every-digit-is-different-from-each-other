 4 digit numbers that every digit is different from each other
 
 The program randomly generates a 4 digits number between 1023 and 9876 that the digits are different from each other.
 The user tries to guess this number. After each prediction of the user, the program reports to the user on how many 
 numbers the user guessed correctly.
 For example, let's assume that the program produces 1234 numbers. If the user answers 2504, the program will report 
 as +1 and -1. Because the user correctly guessed the digit of 2 numbers. He predicted 2 correctly. 
 Since the number "2" exists in a different digit despite the number that should be estimated, the program has produced
 the value "-1" for this. However, since the number "4" was in correct digit, the program produced the value +1.
